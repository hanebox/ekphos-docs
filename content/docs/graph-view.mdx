The Graph View provides a visual representation of your notes and their connections through wiki links. Press `Ctrl+g` to open the graph.

## Overview

The graph displays:
- **Nodes**: Each note in your vault appears as a box with its title
- **Edges**: Lines connecting notes that link to each other via `[[wiki links]]`
- **Bidirectional links**: Shown in green when two notes link to each other
- **Unidirectional links**: Shown in gray for one-way connections

<Callout>
The graph uses a hierarchical tree layout that automatically organizes notes based on their link relationships.

| `Ctrl+j` | Move selected node down |
| `Ctrl+k` | Move selected node up |
| `Ctrl+l` | Move selected node right |

| Drag background | Pan the view |
| Scroll up | Zoom in |
| Scroll down | Zoom out |

## Understanding the Layout

The graph uses automatic hierarchical positioning:

1. **Root notes**: Notes with no incoming links appear at the top
2. **Child notes**: Notes linked from root notes appear on lower levels
3. **Siblings**: Notes at the same depth are arranged horizontally

The layout recalculates when you open the graph view. Any manual node movements are preserved until you close and reopen the graph.

## Tips

- Use wiki links (`[[note name]]`) to create connections between notes
- Bidirectional links (green) indicate strong relationships between topics
- The graph helps identify orphan notes (no connections) and hub notes (many connections)
- Press `Enter` on any node to quickly jump to that note
